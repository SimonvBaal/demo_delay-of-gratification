## Create a dataset

You have access to the "create-data_mischel1972_tewa1.Rmd" file, where you see
how I created some data loosely based on the information provided in the paper.

Please do the same for Experiment 2 and visualise the data. 

Pay attention to how I organised this directory - it helps make it so things 
don't get lost. 

## Tips
Some useful tips that will help you work easier with R:

- You can start a new chunk by pressing Ctrl+Alt+I (Mac: CMD+Opt+I). 

- You can run a line by putting your cursor on the line and pressing Ctrl+Enter.

- Good formatting of your code will help with readability. If you would like R to
format a bunch of code for you, sorting out indentation and the like, press:
Ctrl+Shift+A while selecting a bit of code.

- You can make R not run code by selecting a bunch of it and pressing 
Ctrl+Shift+C. If you press this again, it removes the "#", which will un-comment
your code.
