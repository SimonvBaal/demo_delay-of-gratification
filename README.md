# Teaching Demo for Analysing Experimental Data

We simulate data that resemble the data from Mischel et al. (1972). 

## Working with this project

The script files are in the script sub-directory, and any data is stored in the data sub-directory.
To start working with this project, clone the directory onto your machine and click on the .Rproj file.
